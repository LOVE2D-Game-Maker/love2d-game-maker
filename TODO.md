#TODO List
This file details the next few important tasks that need to be done to the project.
**IT DOESN'T DETAIL ALL THE THINGS THAT MUST BE DONE!!!**

##Developer-related tasks

- [ ] Add working scrollbars to the resource list that appear in the event that the resource list gets too big.
- [ ] Finish the "bubbles" that appear when you try to expand a resource type that contains no resources in the resource list. **Any design will do as long as it looks good/like effort was put into it!**
- [ ] Program a GUI element simulating the Windows "tab control" for future use. ..This one should be relatively easy. ;)
- [ ] Somehow manage to create code to show a native, but cross-platform OS file browser. Maybe through iUP?
- [ ] Fix the bug allowing multiple bubbles to show up in the same (Or roughly the same.) spot. Perferably avoiding having to manually check if a bubble already exists in the general location when spawning it (We should do the checking after the bubble's already been spawned, but before it's been drawn to produce cleaner code.)

##Writer-related tasks
Currently, we need user documentation for the software, as well as some well-written text briefly explaining exactly what this program is
that we can put on [the website](http://lovegamemaker.weebly.com).
