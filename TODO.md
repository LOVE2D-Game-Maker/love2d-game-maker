#TODO List
This file details the next few important tasks that need to be done to the project.
**IT DOESN'T DETAIL ALL THE THINGS THAT MUST BE DONE!!!**

##Developer-related tasks

- [ ] Develop a working GUI.
- [ ] Build a properly extendable framework for the application that allows making Game Maker-esque "actions" through Lua files.

##Writer-related tasks
Currently, we need user documentation for the software, as well as some well-written text briefly explaining exactly what this program is
that we can put on [the website](http://lovegamemaker.weebly.com).
